 ## Description
 To start, I used "npm i" to install all of the dependencies that came in the starter code that I had.  Express.js allowed me to create and run a local server. The application also uses mongoose to store data.
 After I set up a local server with express, I tested the application to ensure it was functional.  

 The application allows the user to enter deposits and withdrawals to keep a running budget.  I added in IndexedDB so the application would have offline functionality.  When a user enters a deposit or withdrawal, the application will notify the user that it was added after the application comes back online.  

 Service workers and a manifest were also added to assist with offline functionality.

 ## Usage 
 The project's intended use is to act as a budget tracker.  A user can keep track of their budget and make withdrawals and deposits to the running total.  The application can be run even when there is little to no internet.
